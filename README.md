# Chemical Compound Time Trend Analysis

This document provides guidelines for preparing the dataset and performing time trend analysis for chemical compounds.

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository using:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YUQIAOTANG/Chemical_compound_for_time_trend_analysis

### 2. Install packages
Depending on your environment, install the necessary dependencies:

#### R environment
```R
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "readxl", "dplyr", "mfuzz","minpack.lm"))

## Dataset Preparation

To ensure proper analysis, the dataset should be formatted as follows:

| Name  | Condition | Concentration | Group |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------|
| Compound A | Condition 1 | 10.5 | Group 1 |
| Compound B | Condition 2 | 15.2 | Group 2 |

Each column represents:
- **Name**: The name of the chemical compound.
- **Condition**: The experimental condition under which the data was collected.
- **Concentration**: The measured concentration of the compound.
- **Group**: The experimental group classification.

## Time Trend Analysis

To perform time trend analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Set the data path**  
   Ensure the dataset is stored as an `.xlsx` file. Specify the file path in the script.

2. **Run the analysis script**  
   Source the provided R script. Upon execution, the following outputs are expected:
   - The **time constant** will be displayed in the terminal.
   - A **trend plot** for the specified compound will be generated and saved in the same directory as the dataset.

By following these steps, you will be able to analyze the temporal trends of chemical compounds efficiently.
